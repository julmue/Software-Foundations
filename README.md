# Software Foundations

My attempt at working through the 
[Software foundations](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html) 
book by Benjamin Pierce et al.

I try to cover all the exercises,
so if you're stuck somewhere you can look for some inspirations 
in the chapters I already finished :wink:.
